# Gesture-Character-Recognition
A computer vision model to predict the English letters and words drawn as an air gesture <br>
This particular model uses Convolution Neural networks for predicting the drawn letter and open cv for live camera operations .
<br>
Requirements: 
-> An object of specific colour for drawing the letter.

Setup a conda environment for working smoothly with tensorflow.
<br>
Training the model -> python model_training.py<br>
Running the model -> python GCR.py   <br>
Train the model with freater number of epochs for higher accuracy.

In the camera feed ,take the object near the camera as the model to detect it and draw the letter.<br>
Keep drawing the letters to create a word and press q to terminate .
